\subsection{Detailed Description}
This class is used to report usage of converted specialized multivectors.

The class is designed to be pretty safe with multi-\/threading without locking. In the wordt case, some memory leaks occur and some counts are missed. The amount of memory leaked is bounded (goes not grow beyond a certain point). Since the report-\/usage functionality is for development/debugging only, this is not considered non-\/harmful. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following files\-:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
e3ga.\-h\item 
e3ga.\-cpp\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
